- **Primary Color**: #2e86ab - [Usage description]
- **Secondary Color**: #2e86ab - [Usage description]  
- **Accent Color**: #2e86ab - [Usage description]
- **Design Style**: Friendly
- **Border Radius**: 8px

### Component Architecture
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development session
pyenv activate haleway
python manage.py runserver

# Common tasks
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py shell
python manage.py test
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Full rebuild with backup
./build.sh -r -d $(date +%Y%m%d)

# Soft rebuild (preserve database)  
./build.sh -s

# Backup only
./build.sh -b -d $(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Code Quality (Modern Tooling)
```bash
# Format and lint with ruff (10-100x faster than black+isort+flake8)
make format      # Auto-format code
make lint        # Check code quality
make type-check  # Type checking with mypy
make security    # Security scan with bandit
make quality     # Run all checks

# Check migrations for unsafe operations
make check-migrations

# Test with coverage
pytest --cov=apps

# Run all pre-commit hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### File Encoding Standards

**CRITICAL: All files MUST be UTF-8 encoded**

This project requires UTF-8 encoding for all files, especially templates. Failure to use UTF-8 will cause `UnicodeDecodeError` when Django tries to render templates.

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Always use UTF-8 encoding** when creating new files
- ✅ **Avoid emojis in template files** - Use HTML entities or Font Awesome icons instead
- ✅ **If using emojis, ensure file is saved as UTF-8**
- ❌ **Never use ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, or other encodings**

**How to Check File Encoding:**
```bash
# Check a file's encoding
file -b --mime-encoding path/to/file.html

# Convert a file from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8
iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 input.html > output.html
```

**Common Error:**
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb0 in position X
```
This means a file is not UTF-8 encoded. Use the commands above to check and fix.

**Editor Configuration:**
- VS Code: Add to settings.json: `"files.encoding": "utf8"`
- PyCharm: Settings → Editor → File Encodings → set to UTF-8
- Vim: Add to .vimrc: `set encoding=utf-8 fileencoding=utf-8`

## Logging Best Practices

**This project uses structlog for structured logging. Always use this pattern:**

### Correct Logging Pattern
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

# ✅ CORRECT - Structured logging with context
logger.info("user_login_success", user_id=user.id, username=user.username, ip=request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR'))
logger.warning("payment_failed", user_id=user.id, amount=amount, reason="insufficient_funds")
logger.error("database_connection_failed", host=db_host, port=db_port, exc_info=True)

# ✅ Adding persistent context
logger = logger.bind(user_id=user.id, request_id=request_id)
logger.info("order_created", order_id=order.id)  # user_id and request_id auto-included

# ✅ Exception logging
try:
    process_payment(order)
except PaymentError as e:
    logger.exception("payment_processing_error", order_id=order.id, amount=order.total)
```

### ❌ WRONG - Don't Do This
```python
# ❌ String formatting loses structure
logger.info(f"User {user.username} logged in from {ip}")

# ❌ No context data
logger.info("Payment failed")

# ❌ Old-style formatting
logger.info("Order %s created by user %s", order.id, user.id)
```

### Why Structured Logging?
- **Searchable**: Query logs by `user_id`, `order_id`, etc.
- **Parseable**: JSON output for log aggregators (ELK, Datadog, etc.)
- **Contextual**: Automatic request_id, user_id tracking
- **Performant**: Faster than string formatting
- **Debuggable**: See all related logs instantly

### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic info (dev only)
- **INFO**: Important business events (`user_registered`, `order_completed`)
- **WARNING**: Recoverable issues (`rate_limit_approached`, `cache_miss`)
- **ERROR**: Errors that need attention (`payment_failed`, `email_send_error`)
- **CRITICAL**: System failures (`database_down`, `out_of_memory`)

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# Development: Colored console output
make run

# Production: JSON logs in logs/django.log
tail -f logs/django.log | jq .  # Pretty-print JSON

# Search logs
grep "user_id.*12345" logs/django.log | jq .
```

## Health Checks & Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
The project includes django-health-check for monitoring:

```python
# Add to config/urls.py:
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ... other patterns
    path('health/', include('health_check.urls')),
]
```

### Available Endpoints
- `/health/` - Overall health status
- `/health/?format=json` - JSON health status

### Checks Included
- **Database**: Connection and query test
- **Cache**: Redis connectivity (if enabled)
- **Storage**: Disk space and file system

### Using Health Checks
```bash
# Check health (server must be running)
make health

# Or manually
curl http://localhost:8000/health/
```

### Production Monitoring
Use `/health/` for:
- **Docker health checks** in docker-compose.yml
- **Kubernetes liveness probes**
- **Load balancer health monitoring**
- **Uptime monitoring services** (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, etc.)

## Modern Tools Included

### Browser Auto-Reload (Development)
- **Package**: django-browser-reload
- **What it does**: Auto-refreshes browser when you save code
- **Setup**: Already configured in development settings
- **No action needed**: Just save your files and watch the magic!

### Migration Safety
- **Package**: django-migration-linter
- **What it does**: Catches unsafe migration operations
- **Prevents**: Adding non-nullable columns, dropping tables without backup, etc.
- **Usage**: Runs automatically in pre-commit hooks
- **Manual check**: `make check-migrations`

### HTTP Client
- **Package**: httpx
- **Use for**: Making API calls (replaces requests)
- **Benefits**: Async support, HTTP/2, connection pooling

```python
import httpx

# Sync usage (like requests)
response = httpx.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Async usage (in async views)
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.get('https://api.example.com/data')
```

## Context for AI Assistants

When working with this project, remember:

1. **UTF-8 Encoding REQUIRED**: All files MUST be UTF-8 encoded. Never create files with ISO-8859-1 or other encodings. Avoid emojis in templates or ensure UTF-8 encoding if used.
2. **Custom CSS System**: Never suggest Bootstrap/Tailwind - we have a complete custom system
3. **Mobile-First**: All UI decisions should start with mobile
4. **pyenv Development**: Local development uses pyenv, not Docker
5. **build.sh Deployment**: Production uses the build.sh script for all operations
6. **Structured Logging**: Always use structlog with key-value pairs, never string formatting
7. **Architecture Patterns**: Follow existing patterns in similar apps (notes, activities, etc.)
8. **Security Requirements**: All family members can edit, only admins can delete
