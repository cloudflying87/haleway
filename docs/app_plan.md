## Indexes & Performance Considerations

**Critical Indexes:**
- `Trip.family_id` + `Trip.status`
- `Activity.trip_id` + `Activity.pre_trip_priority`
- `Activity.trip_id` + `Activity.post_trip_rating`
- `Note.trip_id` + `Note.category_id`
- Full-text search index on `Note.content` and `Note.title`
- `DailyItinerary.trip_id` + `DailyItinerary.date`

---

## Search Strategy

### Searchable Notes and Activities
- Use Django's `search` fields with Postgres full-text search
- Create a combined search view that queries: Notes, Activities, Trip names, Resort names
- Display results with: category, trip name, date range, relevant snippet

### Top Activities Future Search
- Query: `Activity.objects.filter(is_favorite=True, post_trip_rating__gte=4)`
- Include related Trip, Resort data
- Allow filters by destination, date range, activity type

---

## MVP Features (Quick Launch)

**Essential for v1:**
- User authentication & family creation
- Trip creation with resort details
- Activity list with manual distance entry
- Basic note system
- Pre-trip priority ordering

**Can defer:**
- Automatic distance calculation (use Google Maps API later)
- Multi-category notes system (start with single text field)
- Sharing/family permissions
- Post-trip ratings and search
- Budget tracking
- Packing lists

---

## Notes
- Start simple and iterate - get core trip planning working first
- Each phase builds naturally on the previous one
- App is usable after Phase 4
- Focus on family collaboration and memory-keeping
- Keep UI clean and mobile-friendly from the start
